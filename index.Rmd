# COVID-19 Consolidated Policy Indices 
#### A collaboration by the CoronaNet Research Project and Oxford Blavatnik School’s COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT)

<br>

The CoronaNet Research Project and the Oxford Blavatnik School’s COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) have collaborated to create six new indices that provide the first comprehensive and statistically-validated summaries of government policies made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. At present these indices cover 189 countries from January 1st, 2020 to January 15th, 2021. We will be updating these regularly with a next release up until March 15th coming in June of 2021. 

This website provides a non-technical overview of the new indices released by CoronaNet and the OxCGRT projects. For a full description of the creation of these indices and the models employed, we refer you to our [working paper](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rn9xk/). This user guide, by contrast, provides general advice on how these indices can be employed and how to make decisions about when/whether to use the underlying raw data as opposed to the indices.

The six new indices that combine data from both projects are:

* Social distancing index
* Business restrictions index
* Mask index
* Health monitoring index
* Health resources index
* School restrictions index

These indices combine data from 154 CoronaNet policy indicators and 10 OxCGRT policy indicators to produce these 6 separate indices. Each index therefore represents a combination of both data sources. The weights used to create the indices from the underlying indicators were created using a statistical measurement model that assumed there was a single underlying dimension for each policy type (i.e., masks, business restrictions, etc). 

We release these indices with the hope and aim of making information on policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic more accessible to researchers, policy-makers, and the general public. These indices are released in panel dataset format (country - day - policy), which allows for easier analysis of policy changes over time. The current version of the dataset contains country-day observations of over 180 countries.

For a discussion of how to explore the underlying data and fit models with these indices using the R statistical software package, we created a blog post that describes how to access the data in R: https://www.robertkubinec.com/post/err_in_vars/
